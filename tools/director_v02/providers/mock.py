"""Deterministic, keyword-based stand-in translator. NOT an LLM.

This exists so the v0.2/v0.3 pipeline (translate -> validate -> feasibility
-> generate -> QA -> package) is testable end-to-end without a network call
or an API credential, and so its behavior is exactly reproducible run to
run. Do not mistake this for NLU: it is a wider, hand-written keyword net
than v0.1's regex parser (enough to normalize the paraphrases in the test
sets across v0.2/v0.3), not semantic comprehension. It will not generalize
to phrasings outside the patterns below -- a real LLM provider (see
`providers/anthropic_provider.py`) is what actually generalizes.

Security property worth stating plainly: this translator NEVER copies any
substring of the input text into an output field. Every field it emits is a
literal chosen from a fixed, hardcoded Python set/dict based on whether a
keyword was *present*, never based on what surrounding text says. There is
no code path here through which attacker-supplied text could become a
`relationship_predicate`, `domain`, or any other spec value -- the emitted
values are always one of the literals already hardcoded below, full stop.

Decision order (see `translate()`): mixed-unsupported check first (most
specific), then the three registered capability patterns (Draft,
Championship, Player From Clues), then a generic NEEDS_CLARIFICATION
fallback for requests that clearly mention football/NFL content but not
enough to resolve to any of the above, then NO_MATCH for everything else.
